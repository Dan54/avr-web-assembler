This is a browser based assembler for [AVR microcontrollers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers), develpoed for my master's project. 
It is still in development, with the goal being to create a web app that allows users to write, assemble, and load code onto [AT90USB82/162](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/at90usb82) microcontrollers.
